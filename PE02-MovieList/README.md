# Input
The program takes input in the form of a list of movies, each represented as an object with properties such as title, genre, and release year. The user can also select a genre from a dropdown select element to filter the movies based on the selected genre.

# Process
The program uses React components and state management to handle the logic and rendering. It initializes the movie list and selected genre as state variables. The movies are filtered based on the selected genre, and the filtered list is rendered dynamically. User events, such as selecting a genre or clicking on a movie, are handled with event handlers that update the state and trigger corresponding actions.

# Output
The program outputs the movie list, which is rendered as a series of tabs. Each tab displays the movie title, genre, and release year. The movies can be filtered based on the selected genre, and the filtered list is updated in real-time. When a movie tab is clicked, an alert is displayed with the movie title.

This program follows the input-process-output model by taking input in the form of movies and user selections, processing the data using React components and state management, and producing an output of the rendered movie tabs with filtered results and event-driven interactions.
