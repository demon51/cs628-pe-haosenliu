## Input

The React application "Cities" accepts multiple types of user inputs. The first type of input is through the "Add City" page where users can enter details about a city, including its name, country, and population. These inputs are collected through form elements in the "AddCity" component. The second type of input is from clicking on city names in the "Cities List" page, which leads to the "City Details" page. The click event acts as an input triggering the display of city details.

## Process

The main process of the application happens in the "App.js" file. The state of the application, represented by the `cities` variable, is managed here. When a user adds a new city, the `handleAddCity` function updates the `cities` state with the new city's details. The `BrowserRouter` component provides routing functionality, allowing navigation between different pages (routes) in the application. Based on the user's actions (input), the corresponding route and component are rendered. For example, clicking on a city name triggers the display of that city's details by processing the `id` parameter in the URL and finding the corresponding city from the `cities` state.

## Output

The output of the application consists of the various pages that are displayed to the user. The "Cities List" page shows a list of city names, which are links to the "City Details" pages. Clicking on a city name displays the details of that city in the "City Details" page. When a user adds a new city through the "Add City" page, the new city gets added to the "Cities List" page. All the outputs are presented through React components that render the necessary HTML elements to display the data in a user-friendly and visually appealing format. The dynamic rendering of components based on user input and application state showcases the program's input-process-output flow.
