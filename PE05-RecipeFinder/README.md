## Input
Users interact with the React frontend to browse recipes (Recipe List), view specific details (Recipe Details), add new recipes (Add Recipe), and update or delete existing ones. Form inputs capture necessary information like recipe name, ingredients, and cooking instructions.

## Process
When a user action is triggered, the React application communicates with the Node.js/Express backend via API requests. React Router directs users to different components based on URL paths. The backend processes the incoming data, performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and communicates with MongoDB Atlas to persist the recipe data. The useParams hook fetches specific recipe data based on unique identifiers.

## Output
The backend sends a response back to the frontend, which updates its state and renders new information on the screen. This provides real-time feedback, such as a list of recipes, detailed views of selected recipes, or confirmation messages for adding/updating/deleting recipes.

This I-P-O cycle ensures a smooth, interactive user experience.
